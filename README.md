<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>My first time building a line chatbot, encountered tons of problems. I would like to note them down for learning purpose, with more detailed description in my Medium articles, if I did write one about it.</p>
<p>And yes we'll get back to how to set up this App soon, no worry.<p>
<p>I mean, your own line bot.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Here are (some of) the problems I tried to tackle:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Line official account manager: how to create a account, basic setting, documentation, and blablabla...</li>
  <li>Line bot layout: what does a line bot index.js look like?</li>
  <li>Message methods: text, sticker, image and more.</li>
  <li>Ngrok: what's Ngrok? why do I even need Ngrok?</li>
  <li>Rich menu: the image that sends text for you.</li>
  <li>MySQL: I learned some MySQL syntax and connection pool problem because Heroku won't support MongoDB soon.</li>
  <li>JS Callback: to create/read/update/delete data in database or get cats pics via api by sending message to line bot, I revised and learned a lot more about the Asynchronous JavaScript, like callback, Promise, and Await/Async.
  </li>
</ol>
